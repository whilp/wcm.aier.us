# Summary

I'm fascinated by big data in science and on the web.
These huge new datasets present some of today's most exciting challenges, and open source software has given me the tools to help tackle them.
I believe that open standards and free software can not only measure new particles or reveal social networks â€” I believe we can use them to save the world, and I want to help.
