## Summary

I'm fascinated by big data in science and on the web.
These huge new datasets present some of today's most exciting challenges, and open source software has given me the tools to help tackle them.
I believe that open standards and free software can not only measure new particles or reveal social networks — I believe we can use them to save the world, and I want to help.

## Experience

### Systems Programmer 
#### [University of Wisconsin][] [CMS Tier 2 Center] (2006–)

 * Led operations of the University's NSF- and DOE-supported LHC physics analysis center.
 * Grew Linux cluster from 200 to 2300 cores for analysis and from 100 terabytes to 1.2 petabytes for distributed data storage.
 * Developed custom software in Python to monitor cluster performance.
 * Led transition from Cfengine to Puppet to improve cluster management.
 * Optimized performance of critical PostgreSQL database servers.
 * Analyzed security breaches and developed proactive measures to increase site and user security.
