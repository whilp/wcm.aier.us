title: Colophon

This site is written in plain text, converted from [Markdown] to [HTML5] using [wrender], responsively styled, typeset in [Open Sans] and deployed to Amazon's [S3] and [Cloudfront] using scripts based on [Boto].

The text files that become these web pages and the bits of code that glue them  and S3/Cloudfront together are stored in a [Mercurial] repository hosted at [Github] \([seriously][hg-git]\).
