title: Colophon

This site is written in plain text, converted from [Markdown] to [XHTML5] using [Pandoc], responsively styled with [GGS], typeset in [Open Sans] and deployed to Amazon's [S3] and [Cloudfront] using scripts based on [Boto].

The text files that become these web pages and the bits of code that glue them, Pandoc and S3/Cloudfront together are stored in a [Mercurial] repository hosted at [Github] ([seriously](hg-git)).
